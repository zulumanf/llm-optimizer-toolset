# DECISIONS.md — Architecture Decision Log

Append-only. Every non-obvious technical decision gets a dated entry: the decision, the why, and what was rejected. Never edit past entries — supersede them with a new dated entry.

## 2026-07-27 — Initial decisions

### Why Postgres?
Experiments are relational to the core: projects → prompt sets → runs → responses → mentions → scores. We need transactions (freezing a prompt set atomically), foreign keys (a score must always trace to a response), and mature JSON support (raw provider payloads in `jsonb`). Rejected: document stores (weak integrity guarantees for an evidence system), SQLite (fine locally, but we need concurrent workers + hosted access).

### Why Next.js (App Router)?
One deployable for UI + API via server actions, first-class TypeScript, and the team already works in React. Internal tool → no need for a separate API service. Rejected: separate SPA + Express API (two deployables, duplicated types), Remix (no team familiarity advantage).

### Why Supabase?
Managed Postgres with auth, row-level security, and storage in one place — minimal ops for an internal tool. We use it as *hosted Postgres first*; features like RLS are additive. Rejected: self-hosted Postgres (ops burden), PlanetScale (MySQL, weaker JSON).

### Why immutable prompt runs and raw responses?
The entire product is an evidence system. If historical data can change, every report becomes unfalsifiable and every trend line untrustworthy. Insert-only raw responses + append-only runs make results reproducible and auditable forever. Cost (storage growth) is trivial next to the value.

### Why version prompt sets (freeze before run)?
Comparing week-over-week scores is only valid if the prompts are identical. Freezing creates an immutable snapshot (`prompt_set_versions`) that runs reference. Editing prompts creates a new version; old runs keep pointing at the version they used.

### Why version scoring methodology?
Weights and equations will evolve. If we silently change them, historical comparisons break. Every computed score row stores `scoring_version`; changing methodology means a new version applied forward (with optional re-scoring stored as *additional* rows, never overwriting).

### Why no microservices?
One team, one internal tool. Microservices buy independent scaling and team isolation — we need neither. They cost deployment complexity, network failure modes, and duplicated logic. A monolith + one worker process covers everything on the roadmap.

### Why a provider abstraction for AI calls (`lib/ai/`)?
We query 4+ providers whose SDKs, auth, and response shapes differ and change. One interface (`runPrompt(provider, model, prompt) → RawResponse`) isolates churn, centralizes retry/rate-limit logic, and makes "add a provider" a one-file change. Rejected: calling vendor SDKs from features (already burned every team that tried).

### Why dev-mode auth before Supabase auth?
No Supabase project exists yet, and spec 001 needs identity for audit rows and role checks. `lib/auth.ts` is a small abstraction: `AUTH_MODE=dev` serves a single env-configured local user (stable UUID); `AUTH_MODE=supabase` is wired to fail loudly until implemented. Role enforcement lives in services either way, so swapping the identity source later touches one file. Supersede this entry when Supabase auth lands.

### Why postgres.js + a hand-rolled migration runner (no ORM)?
The schema is the product (`docs/03`) — we want hand-written SQL with triggers (insert-only enforcement) that ORMs make awkward. `postgres` (postgres.js) gives tagged-template queries, transactions, and camelCase mapping with zero codegen. Migrations are plain SQL files with `-- +migrate up/down` markers run by `scripts/migrate.ts` (~100 lines, transactional, tracked in `schema_migrations`). Rejected: Prisma/Drizzle (schema drift between ORM DSL and the trigger-heavy SQL we actually need), Supabase CLI migrations (couples us to Supabase tooling before we're on Supabase).

### Local dev database
Homebrew `postgresql@14`, pre-existing install, configured on **port 5433** (left as found). Databases `llm_optimizer_dev` and `llm_optimizer_test`; integration tests remap `DATABASE_URL` to `TEST_DATABASE_URL` in `tests/setup.ts` so they can never touch dev data.

### Official provider SDKs with our own retry layer (spec 003)
Adapters use `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `openai` rather than raw fetch — typed
errors, correct auth handling, maintained request shapes. SDK-internal retries
are disabled (`maxRetries: 0`) so `lib/ai/retry.ts` is the single retry policy
for every provider: uniform backoff, budget checks between attempts, refusals
never retried (docs/12). Cost math uses integer micro-dollars (µ$ = tokens ×
$/MTok) to avoid float drift; per-model prices are pinned in
`lib/ai/pricing.ts` with a verified flag — unverified models are called out in
the run-estimate UI.

### Baseline cron config as columns on projects (spec 003)
The weekly baseline needs per-project config (which set, which providers,
what budget). Rather than a settings table for two fields, they live as
`baseline_prompt_set_id` + `baseline_config` jsonb on projects, set via SQL
for now. Promote to a settings UI when a second consumer appears.

### Playwright E2E deferred to the CI milestone
Spec 001's unit/integration coverage exercises every acceptance criterion including DB triggers and role checks. Browser E2E adds most value once there's a multi-step flow (freeze → run → review, specs 002–004); installing browser tooling now would slow the vertical slice. Recorded as a scope cut in spec 001; E2E lands with CI setup before spec 003 completes.

### Why `specs/` separate from `docs/`?
`docs/` explains why the system exists and how it holds together — stable, read for context. `specs/` are executable work orders — one feature, implemented exactly, then done. Mixing them makes docs churn and specs vague.
